# ai-support-notebooks

This repository contains the Python notebooks developed at the Ghent University Department of Translation, Interpreting and Communication. Below, a brief description of the topics tackled by the notebooks is presented:
- `IAA`: Annotating (i.e. labelling or categorising) data constitutes an important aspect of many research experiments. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) metrics quantify the overlap between annotations from different annotators. IAA scores can provide valuable insights into the research data, especially when the data are used to train machine learning models.
- `WSD`: It is very common for the same word form to have multiple possible meanings (e.g., *bat* as a baseball stick and *bat* as a night animal). The computational resolution of lexically ambiguous words - commonly referred to as word sense disambiguation or WSD - is a pending issue in the domain of natural language processing.
